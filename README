This is hopefully a start at a proper POX manual.  The idea is for it
to be a combination of "hand written" documentation as well as
autogenerated reference.

create-skeletons.py is an attempt at building the autogenerated
portion in a way that keeps it relatively independent of the
stuff that one might wish to write by hand.  As none of the latter
has actually been written at this point, it's hard to say how well
that goal is being achieved so far.

How to make the documentation:

1) Install Sphinx
   sudo easy_install -U Sphinx
2) Create skeleton doc files
   python create-skeletons.py
3) Generate documentation
   make html
4) Read your new documentation
   It's in _build/html/index.html
